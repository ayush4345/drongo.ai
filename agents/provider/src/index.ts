// @drongo/agent-provider — metered provider services sold per call through the
// @drongo/agent-core channel. Consumers buy these via signed vouchers and settle
// once with a ZK proof. Each service is keyless (no API key) so it runs offline
// in tests (injectable HttpClient) and live without secrets.
//
// It also exposes an x402 HTTP resource server (createProviderServer): the
// provider is the thing exposing the endpoint, so the server lives here. See
// serve.ts for the runnable entrypoint (`pnpm --filter @drongo/agent-provider serve`).
